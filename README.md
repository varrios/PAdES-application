# PAdES-application

Project is a part of the assignment in Computer Systems Security course at GdaÅ„sk University of Technology.
The main task of the project is to design and develop an application to make a qualified electronic signature according to PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signature) standard concept.

## How to Run the App

Project has been developed with **Python 3.13.2**

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varrios/PAdES-application.git
   cd PAdES-application

   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On MacOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the main script in directory of application you want to use:**

   ```bash
   python auxiliary_app/main.py
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python signature_app/main.py
   ```

## Project Overview

In general, the application must take a form of a _set of
tools for realization the qualified electronic signature_. The general concept is pointed
out in Fig. 1. Additionally to the main application, user has a 2nd auxiliary application
for generating a pair of RSA keys and securing the private key. The encrypted private
key will be stored on a pendrive and it will be used for signing the document.

### General usage scenario:

The user **A** has a hardware tool (a pendrive) with encrypted private RSA key. The
key is encrypted by AES algorithm using as a key userâ€™s PIN number. The PIN is given
by the user during generating a pair of RSA keys using an auxiliary application. The
application for PAdES signature must automatically identify the hardware tool and read
the private key to sign the _.pdf document. Before signing the document, user **A** must
enter the PIN number to decrypt the private RSA key. Regarding the concept of PAdES
standard, the electronic signature is attached inside _.pdf document.

The second user **B** must have a possibility to verify the signature (using the same
application), by having the public key of user **A** and the signed document. During the
verification user **B** generates the hash from the document and verifies it with the hash
generated by user **A** (after proper RSA decryption).

## Project Requirements and Features

- The GUI interface must allow to select any document ( _\*.pdf_ ) that will be signed.
- The signature must use the RSA algorithm with a 4096-length key.
- A pseudorandom generator must be used to generate the RSA keys.
- The private key stored on the pendrive must be encrypted by the AES algorithm,
  where the 256 - bit key is the hash from PIN known only to user A.
- Pendrive usage for storing the private RSA key is obligatory. The pendrive must
  be detected and the encrypted RSA key automatically loaded to the main
  application.
- The public key can be stored on the hard disk of the computer or be transferred
  to another physical computer to verify the signature.
- It is obligatory to implement status/message icons to present the state of the
  application (recognition of hardware tool, reading the private key, signature
  status).
- It is assumed that only user A can sign the documents, there is no need to create
  keys for two or more users.
- It is allowed to use the available implementations / libraries of the AES, RSA,
  SHA algorithms.
- Any language can be used to develop the application.
- In the report, a brief description of performed tests must be included (e.g.
  signing scenarios, signature verification, encryption/decryption of other files).
- In the report the code of the application must be partially included in a form of
  listings, pointing out the main functions of the application. It is strongly advised
  to provide a short and substantive description.
- The full code documentation must be created using Doxygen documentation
  generator.
- It is obligatory to include the applications code in GitHub repository and provide
  the link in the final report.
- Application functionality must be presented during project submission.
